## simple


Runs all Cypress tests without recording results on the Dashboard. Installs dependencies with "npm ci", caches NPM modules and Cypress binary. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run

```

## recording


Runs all Cypress tests and records them on the [Cypress Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard-service). Requires `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` environment variable to be set. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          record: true

```

## parallel-on-2-machines


Runs all Cypress tests by load balancing them on two machines. Note that first a single job installs NPM dependencies, then 2 jobs run the tests in parallel using Cypress Dashboard [parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization). 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          record: true
          parallel: true
          parallelism: 2
          group: 2 machines

```

## yarn


Installs NPM dependencies using "yarn install --frozen-lockfile" command, then runs Cypress tests. Caches NPM modules and Cypress binary. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          yarn: true

```

## custom-cache-key


Apply custom key for npm install (or yarn install) cache. Useful to tweak caching settings to your liking. Related options "yarn". 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          yarn: true
          cache-key: 'yarn-packages-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}'

```

## using-node6


Runs all Cypress tests on Node 6 image by specifying `executor` name. There are several executors included with this orb, and you can use your own executor, see "custom-executor" example. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          executor: cypress/base-6

```

## chrome


Runs tests using Chrome browser in a custom executor - a Docker image that includes Chrome browser. See [`--browser`](https://on.cypress.io/launching-browsers) Cypress run option documentation. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          executor: cypress/browsers-chrome69
          browser: chrome

```

## start-server


Often we need to start a local webserver before running end-to-end tests. This option runs the given command to starts the server in the background and then runs all Cypress tests. Related option "wait-on". 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          start: npm start

```

## wait-for-server-to-respond


Starts server, waits for it to respond and then runs all Cypress tests. Uses `npx wait-on ...` command under the hood, see [wait-on](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on#readme). Note, if you are using Webpack server, it might not respond to the default HTTP OPTIONS request. In that case use `wait-on` to send `HTTP GET` request by using url `wait-on: 'http-get://localhost:....'`. You can also pass `wait-on` config, see [issue #90](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb/issues/90). Related option "start" 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:4200'

```

## build-app


Install dependencies and run a custom build command on one machine that builds the web application. Then runs Cypress tests on 3 machines and balances them using [Dashboard parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization). 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install:
          build: npm run build
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          record: true
          parallel: true
          parallelism: 3
          group: 3x

```

## groups


Runs all tests on 4 machines using Electron browser (default). Also runs some tests using "spec" parameter on Chrome browser. Records both groups on Cypress dashboard. Notice "name" under each "cypress/run" job which will be shown in the Circle workflow UI to tell jobs apart. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install
      - cypress/run:
          name: 4 machines
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          record: true
          parallel: true
          parallelism: 4
          group: 4 machines
      - cypress/run:
          name: Chrome
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          executor: cypress/browsers-chrome69
          record: true
          parallel: true
          parallelism: 2
          group: smoke tests
          browser: chrome
          spec: cypress/integration/smoke/*

```

## release


If you want to run an entire job after running Cypress tests, you can reuse the workspace from the `cypress/run` job. For example, to run a semantic release script you could follow this example. Note - for simpler steps you can use "post-steps" parameter, see "store-test-reports" example. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
jobs:
  release:
    executor: cypress/base-10
    steps:
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/
      - run: npm run semantic-release
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install
      - release:
          requires:
            - cypress/run

```

## linux-and-mac


Runs tests on Linux and on Mac via two jobs. Note how the user defines and uses own executor "mac" 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
executors:
  mac:
    macos:
      xcode: 10.1.0
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          name: Linux test
      - cypress/run:
          name: Mac test
          executor: mac

```

## custom-executor


Use any executor to run the job defined by the orb. Assumes the executor has all OS dependencies necessary to run Cypress. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
executors:
  with-chrome:
    docker:
      - image: 'cypress/browsers:chrome69'
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          executor: with-chrome

```

## env-vars


Set additional environment variables when running Cypress tests by adding them to the executor. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
executors:
  base10-foo-bar:
    docker:
      - image: 'cypress/base:10'
    environment:
      FOO: foo
      BAR: bar
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          executor: base10-foo-bar

```

## install-private-npm-modules


In this example, we write the NPM auth token before running "npm install" command. This allows us to install private NPM modules for example. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install:
          pre-steps:
            - run: 'echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > ~/.npmrc'
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install

```

## store-test-reports


Stores test results using post-steps parameter, see https://on.cypress.io/reporters, assumes that reports are saved in folder "cypress/results". Also see "artifacts" parameter. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          post-steps:
            - store_test_results:
                path: cypress/results

```

## artifacts


Stores test screenshots and videos as CircleCI artifacts using "store_artifacts" job option. Note, this setting assumes the default Cypress folders for screenshots and videos. If you store screenshots and videos in custom folders, see "any-artifacts" example how to store arbitrary folders. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          store_artifacts: true

```

## any-artifacts


Stores additional folders like "mochawesome-report" or code coverage folder as a CircleCI artifact. Related option "artifacts". 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          post-steps:
            - store_artifacts:
                path: mochawesome-report

```

## custom-command


Use your own arbitrary command to launch Cypress tests.

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          command: npx cypress run --record

```

## no-workspace


Faster "cypress/run" job that does not attach workspace, because there are no jobs that follow, so no need to save files. 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          no-workspace: true

```

## private-npm-module


This example shows how to install private NPM modules using NPM_TOKEN environment variable using "pre-steps" parameter. Then it starts the server, waits for it to respond and runs Cypress tests. Then it publishes a new version of the current module using semantic-release script (using the same NPM_TOKEN variable to publish). 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          pre-steps:
            - run: 'echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > ~/.npmrc'
          no-workspace: true
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3003'
          post-steps:
            - run: npm run semantic-release

```

## custom-directory


Runs all commands in a custom directory, this is useful when using a monorepo where the `package.json` file isn't at the root of the repository (eg. in the `frontend/` subfolder). 

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          yarn: true
          working_directory: frontend

```

Additionally, monorepo users may want to provide a `cache-key` parameter to key the cache with an appropriate checksum. (i.e. `cache-key: 'cache-{{ arch }}-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "frontend/package.json" }}'`)

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install:
          cache-key: cache-{{ arch }}-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "frontend/package.json" }}
      - cypress/run:
          yarn: true
          cache-key: cache-{{ arch }}-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "frontend/package.json" }}
          working_directory: frontend

```
